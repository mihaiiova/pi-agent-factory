# Pi Forge — roadmap

Based on an audit of the repository at v0.18.0 (`217fc0b`, 2026-10-28), measured
against [the product direction](product-direction.md). Issues live in
GitHub under epic [#24](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/24), indexed
at the end. Each one is scoped for a single implementation session.

## Status (2026-10-30)

- **Shipped:** #25 and #41 in v0.19.0; #27 (the rename and `/forge`) and #28
  (Pi's built-in MCP) in v0.20.0; #34 (`./run --workflow`, the headless
  invocation contract) and #32 (`/forge check` and `check-agent`) in v0.21.0.
  The repository is `mihaiiova/pi-forge`.
- **Versioning:** Forge stays below 1.0 for now; #27 planned 1.0.0, and that was
  deferred. Pre-1.0 releases may break projects, which are regenerated.
- **First agent:** Revisor, a web and CLI testing bot exposed to other agents
  over MCP, built with v0.21.0. Building it produced #42 and specs #43–#53,
  all general to any Forge agent, and extended #35 and #40.
- **Next, in order:**
  1. #43, #44 and #35: structured results, a folder per run, and the run
     index linking sessions, specialist transcripts, files and cost.
  2. #53 (a separate model for `/forge`), #45 (keep specialists in their
     project) and #50 (first-run guidance).
  3. #49 (setup steps).
  4. #47 (recorded commands), then #48 (a Gondolin sandbox, Pi-native,
     installed at setup).
  5. #46 (workflows over MCP).
  6. #40 (run evidence in revisions).
  7. #51 (`/forge` changing project code, design first).
  8. #52 (skill suggestions for unattended agents).

  Evals are deferred. #33, #29 and #30 come when an agent needs them.
- **Known limitations:**
  - A personal Forge install from a local checkout loads next to a project's
    pin, so commands appear twice inside generated projects (install from the
    git tag instead).
  - Plain `pi mcp list` in a project's isolated home ignores the project until
    trust is saved; `/mcp` inside `./run` works, and `check-agent --connect`
    saves the trust itself.
  - `./run --workflow` needs one interactive `./run` first, which installs the
    pinned Forge package that holds the runner.
  - Without a systemd user scope (always on macOS), a timeout stops the process
    group and the invocation's pi-subagents runs; a process that detaches on
    its own can survive.

## 1. Audit: what exists today

Facts below come from the source and from running the tests. Where something
is inferred instead, it is marked as an assumption.

- **Tests:** `bash skills/agent-factory/test/test.sh` passes: 25 node suites
  (≈215 tests) and 8 shell suites. Live inference and clean-environment network
  tests are opt-in and were skipped.
- **Size:** ≈5,900 lines of `.mjs`, of which ≈1,600 are maintenance
  (`maintenance*.mjs`).

| Capability | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Conversational design (explore → synthesize → build) | Implemented, satisfactory | `SKILL.md`; scenarios in `docs/agent-factory-conversation.md`; skill-contract test |
| Declarative model and validator (`system.yaml` schema 1) | Implemented, satisfactory | `validate.mjs`, `schema.md`; strict unknown-key and reference checks |
| Deterministic generation, ownership, dry-run, idempotence | Implemented, satisfactory | `generate.mjs`; golden fixtures; fingerprint conflicts |
| Isolated launcher (`./run`) | Implemented, satisfactory | `runtime.mjs`; launcher and isolation suites |
| Per-agent models and thinking | Implemented, satisfactory | `models.mjs` |
| Skills from skills.sh (search, preview, pin, project-local install) | Implemented, satisfactory | `registry-skills.mjs`, `skill-sources.mjs` |
| Specialists, enforced tool allowlists, background launch for extension/MCP tools | Implemented, satisfactory | `policy.mjs`, `generate.mjs` (`needsBackground`), `asking.mjs` |
| Calls that ask the user, kept with the orchestrator | Implemented, satisfactory | `asking.mjs`; generated "What you can use" sections |
| Declared CLI commands with per-run approval, `request_permission` | Implemented, satisfactory | `cli-tools.mjs`, `permissions-extension.mjs` |
| MCP configuration, env-var credentials, hidden tools, `approveTools` | Implemented; **to be replaced** | `mcp-gen.mjs`. Depends on `pi-mcp-adapter` and disables Pi 1.4's built-in MCP (`-builtin:mcp` in `generate.mjs`). Moving to the built-in (#28) |
| Documents (agreed formats, MCP delivery) | Implemented, satisfactory | `documents.mjs` |
| Memory (`.pi/MEMORY.md`) | Implemented, satisfactory | `memory.mjs`, `agent-extension.mjs` |
| Revision via `/factory-update <request>` → preview → `apply` | Implemented, satisfactory | `maintenance-extension.mjs` (`factory_plan`), `maintenance.mjs` (`planChange`) |
| Builder-time discovery (`factory discover`) | **Partial** | Covers models, the user's skills, MCP config files, project agents and named CLIs. Pi packages and extensions are not covered (`factory.mjs` `runDiscover`) |
| Revision-time discovery (`factory_plan discover`) | **Partial** | skills.sh, npm free-text search (not filtered to `keywords:pi-package`), MCP registry, docs fetch |
| Package inspection before proposal | **Missing** | `packages[]` is only checked for a pinned spec (`deps.mjs`). Nothing reports what a package loads or registers, its install scripts, or its license |
| Selecting a subset of a package's resources | **Missing** | Pi supports `{source, extensions, skills, prompts}` filters (Pi `docs/packages.md`). `packages[]` accepts strings only |
| Effective-capability verification | **Partial** | `capabilities.json` is derived from declarations only. `launchCheck` checks subagent tools at session start against cached MCP lists and live registrations. It checks only the orchestrator's CLI commands, and there is no explicit command to run it |
| Workflows | **Partial** | Declared boundaries plus a generated orchestrating skill (`workflow-skill.mjs`). `trigger.kind` is `manual` or `headless`. There is no defined way to invoke one headlessly, and no exit-status or output contract |
| Scheduling and event triggers | **Missing** | Deferred by design in the MVP (`docs/agent-factory.md` decision 2) |
| Execution history | **Partial** | Pi sessions in `.factory/pi-home/sessions`. `subagentRuns` summarizes `pi-subagents` launches. Top-level headless runs are not recorded |
| Functional verification | **Missing** | `workflows[].verify` is free text. Live tests are opt-in and generic, not agent-specific |
| Maintenance: versioned bundles, integrity, update checks, rebuild, rollback, recovery | Implemented; **to be removed** | ≈1,600 lines plus a 478-line doc. Replaced by a pinned Pi package (#41) |
| Import of non-Forge Pi projects | Implemented, satisfactory | `import.mjs` |
| Generating into an existing repository (use case C) | **Defect** | An existing `.gitignore` is kept unchanged, so `.factory/` (including `pi-home/auth.json`) and `.env` are not ignored. Reproduced with `factory generate` on a repository that has its own `.gitignore` |
| A coding harness reading its repository's own `AGENTS.md` | **Missing** | The launcher always passes `--no-context-files`, which also drops the project's own file |

**Owlie marketing agent** (`~/projects/owlie/marketing`, read only). It is on
0.18.0 and built with 0.18.0. It has OpenSEO and PostHog MCP, six declared
`gh` commands, `pi-web-access` (added by hand as a package, with nothing
attributing `web_search` to it), one declared workflow (`baseline`) and no
schedule. Its `run-history.jsonl` holds three failed specialist launches and no
record of the top-level runs. Search Console is reached only through OpenSEO's
`get_search_console_performance`. These observations shaped Milestones 1, 2
and 4. The agent itself is not carried forward: it will be rebuilt from scratch
with Forge.

## 2. Most significant gaps

1. **Packages and extensions are opaque.** Forge can pin a package but cannot
   say what it will load, register or execute, or whether a needed tool
   actually comes from it.
2. **No unattended execution.** There is no workflow invocation contract, no
   run record and no scheduling.
3. **Configured is not shown to work.** Checks stop at structure and
   availability. Agent-specific behavior is never exercised.
4. **Revision has little evidence.** It has only specialist-launch summaries
   and tool-failure flags from the current conversation.
5. **Credential exposure when generating into an existing repository**
   (defect).
6. **Naming and commands.** Old names, plus `/factory-update update`,
   `/factory-update check` (which checks for tooling updates, not the agent),
   and `apply` as a separate command.

## 3. Considered and rejected

| Proposal | Why rejected |
|---|---|
| A separate "conversational modification" feature | `/factory-update <request>` already inspects, proposes a small change, previews it and applies on approval. The real gaps are evidence (M4), schedules (M2) and the command surface (M0) |
| Execution evidence exposed as its own feature | Folded into M4: it needs the run index (M2) first |
| A plugin API or capability marketplace | Composition uses Pi packages, npm, the MCP registry and skills.sh as they are (non-goal) |
| A Forge scheduler or daemon | M2 configures an existing provider (`agents-cron`) |
| A migration bridge, `.factory/` → `.forge/` migration, compatibility aliases | No installed base to protect. Agents built by older versions are regenerated |
| A separate in-project maintenance skill | One `forge` skill designs outside a project and revises inside one |
| Keeping `pi-mcp-adapter` | Pi has built-in MCP; built-ins are always preferred |
| A memory database or vector store | `.pi/MEMORY.md`, project files and Pi sessions cover the reference cases |
| A general evaluation framework or LLM grading | M3 checks observable behavior only |
| Implementing several schedule backends, or a systemd fallback | One provider |
| Per-build package pins (an idea in earlier notes) | No reference use case needs it yet |
| An investigation into naming | The name is decided: Pi Forge, `/forge` |
| Trading execution for use case B | Out of scope until enforceable risk and permission boundaries exist |

## 4. Milestones

Milestones may overlap. A hard dependency is a GitHub "Blocked by" link; a
soft one is noted as *after*.

### Milestone 0: Packaging, rename, command surface, and a security fix

Goes first because everything later is written against the new names and the
smaller codebase. There is no migration: projects built by older versions are
regenerated.

- [#25](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/25) `fix-existing-repo-gitignore`: protect `.factory/` and `.env` when generating
  into an existing repository. No dependencies; small.
- [#41](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/41) `forge-package`: ship Forge as a Pi package pinned in each project's
  `.pi/settings.json`, and delete the bundle, front-door, update-check and
  recovery machinery.
- [#27](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/27) `forge-rename`: **Rename pi-agent-factory to pi-forge and consolidate
  commands under /forge.** A plain rename with no aliases. Blocked by
  `forge-package`.

#25 and #41 shipped in v0.19.0, #27 in v0.20.0.

[#26](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/26) (the migration bridge) was closed: nothing needs to be migrated.

### Milestone 1: Capability composition

- [#28](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/28) `mcp-builtin`: replace `pi-mcp-adapter` with Pi's built-in MCP.
  *After* `forge-package`, since the approval gate moves into the agent
  runtime. Shipped in v0.20.0.
- [#29](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/29) `package-discovery`: find candidate Pi packages for a requested capability.
- [#30](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/30) `package-inspection`: inspect an exact package version before proposing it.
- [#31](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/31) `package-resource-selection`: load only the package resources an agent
  needs. Blocked by `package-inspection`.
- [#32](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/32) `capability-check`: verify effective runtime capabilities (`/forge check`). Shipped in v0.21.0.
  *After* `mcp-builtin`.
- [#33](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/33) `coding-harness-context`: opt in to the repository's own `AGENTS.md` (use
  case C).

### Milestone 2: Execution and triggers

- [#34](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/34) `workflow-invocation`: a headless workflow invocation contract. Shipped in v0.21.0.
- [#35](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/35) `run-index`: record each headless run. Blocked by `workflow-invocation`.
- [#37](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/37) `workflow-schedule`: declare a schedule and install it with `agents-cron`.
  Blocked by `workflow-invocation` and `run-index`.

[#36](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/36) (choosing the scheduler) was closed with the decision in §6.

### Milestone 3: Functional verification

- [#38](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/38) `acceptance-scenarios`: declare scenarios and evaluate a run against them.
  Blocked by `run-index`.
- [#39](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/39) `scenario-runner`: run scenarios safely and report diagnostics. Blocked by
  `workflow-invocation` and `acceptance-scenarios`. *After*
  `capability-check`.

### Milestone 4: Operational evolution

- [#40](https://github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge/issues/40) `run-evidence-revision`: revisions and `/forge status` use run evidence.
  Blocked by `run-index`. *After* `scenario-runner`.

```

`─▶` blocks; `··▶` should come after.

## 6. Decisions (2026-10-29)

- **MCP: Pi's built-in.** Built-ins are always preferred over packages. The
  built-in covers what Forge used the adapter for: `hidden` exposure and
  `toolExposure` for hiding, `--tools 'mcp__<server>__*'` for per-agent
  selection, `pi mcp list --json` for checks, OAuth. It has no `approveTools`;
  per-call approval becomes a `tool_call` gate in Forge's agent runtime, which
  Pi applies to every MCP call, including calls from codemode scripts (Pi
  `docs/mcp.md`, Permissions). Implemented by #28.
- **Scheduler: `agents-cron`.** Of the two packages that run with Pi closed,
  it is the more used and more maintained one (npm, 28 Sep–27 Oct 2026: 2,893
  downloads vs 473 for `pi-tick`; 66 commits in that month and 18 releases vs 4
  commits and no release since 2 Oct). It keeps its store in the project
  (`.agents/cron/`), runs one isolated session per run, and its CLI (`add
  --cron … --agent pi`, `remove`, `list --json`) is all Forge needs, so agents
  never get scheduling tools. Risks: it is young (created Sep 2026) and
  AGPL-3.0. Forge neither bundles nor modifies it (Pi installs it from npm
  and Forge calls its CLI), so it should not affect Forge's own license;
  recheck if that changes. No fallback provider.
  Implemented by #37.
- **Distribution: a pinned Pi package.** Each project pins
  `git:github.com/mihaiiova/pi-forge@vX.Y.Z` in `.pi/settings.json`. Pi
  installs it, a pin cannot move, a project entry replaces a personal install
  of the same package (so `/forge` registers once), and git provides history
  and rollback. This drops the frozen front door, the bundles, the update-check
  cache and the transaction journal. What is given up: offline first install,
  bundle integrity manifests (a pinned tag stands in for them), and a separate
  version for the agent runtime and the tooling. Implemented by #41.
- **No separate maintenance skill.** One `forge` skill: design mode outside a
  Forge project, revise mode inside one.
